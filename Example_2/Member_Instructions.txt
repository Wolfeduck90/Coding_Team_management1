## Critical Success Factors

1. **Daily standups are mandatory** - Keep communication tight
2. **Git workflow discipline** - Commit frequently, use branches
3. **Documentation as you go** - Don't leave it all for the end
4. **Test early and often** - Catch issues before final integration
5. **Buffer time built in** - Each day has 30 minutes slack for unexpected issues

## Emergency Protocols

If any team member falls behind:
- **Day 1-2**: Project Lead redistributes tasks
- **Day 3-4**: Other team members pick up critical path items
- **Day 5+**: Focus on core deliverables, deprioritize stretch goals

## Communication Schedule

- **Daily standups**: 9:00 AM (15-30 minutes)
- **End-of-day check-ins**: 5:30 PM (15 minutes)
- **Emergency Slack channel**: For urgent blockers
- **Major decision meetings**: As scheduled above

This timeline ensures all deliverables are completed with quality while providing buffer time for unexpected challenges. The parallel work streams maximize efficiency while maintaining clear ownership and accountability.
