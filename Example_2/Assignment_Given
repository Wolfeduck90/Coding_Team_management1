AI Machine Learning Assignment
Description
Week 2 Assignment: AI for Sustainable Development
Theme: "Machine Learning Meets the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)" 🌍🤖

Objective

Design a machine learning model or AI-driven solution that addresses one of the UN SDGs using concepts from Week 2 (e.g., supervised/unsupervised learning, neural networks, NLP, or reinforcement learning). Your project should demonstrate how AI can contribute to solving global challenges like poverty, climate change, or inequality.

Need Help?

Use Week 2 materials (quiz answers, slides) for ML concepts.

Post questions in the forum with hashtag #SDGAssignment.

Check out Google Colab for cloud-based coding.

Submission

Share your GitHub repo (include Intro Readme file with screenshots  of the project demo and .py files) to finish the assignment.

Write an article of your project explaining the SDG problem you are solving and how your project brings a fitting solution to the problem. Share this article on the PLP Academy Community on the LMS.

Create a compelling elevation pitch deck for your project and share on the Groups for Peer Reviews.

Assignment Structure
1. Choose Your SDG and Problem

Pick one SDG and a specific problem within it. Examples:

SDG 3 (Health): Predict disease outbreaks using health data.

SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities): Optimize public transport routes with clustering.

SDG 13 (Climate Action): Forecast carbon emissions using regression.

2. Select an ML Approach

Supervised Learning: Predict outcomes (e.g., crop yields for SDG 2: Zero Hunger).

Unsupervised Learning: Cluster data (e.g., group regions by pollution levels for SDG 6: Clean Water).

Reinforcement Learning: Simulate sustainable resource allocation (e.g., energy distribution).

3. Dataset & Tools

Datasets: Use free, open-source data (e.g., World Bank Open Data, UN SDG Database, or Kaggle).

Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch.

4. Build Your Model

Preprocess Data: Clean, normalize, and split data.

Train Model: Use techniques like decision trees, CNNs, or NLP (e.g., sentiment analysis of social media for SDG 5: Gender Equality).

Evaluate: Apply metrics (accuracy, MAE, F1-score) and visualize results.

5. Ethical Reflection

How might bias in your data affect outcomes?

How does your solution promote fairness and sustainability?

Deliverables

Code: A Python notebook or script with comments explaining your workflow.

Report: A 1-page summary of:

SDG problem addressed.

ML approach used (e.g., "K-means clustering for urban waste analysis").

Results and ethical considerations.

Presentation: A 5-minute demo showcasing your model’s impact.

Example Projects

SDG 7 (Clean Energy): Predict solar energy potential using weather data (supervised learning).

SDG 4 (Education): Cluster students by learning patterns to recommend resources (unsupervised learning).

SDG 15 (Life on Land): Use CNNs to detect deforestation in satellite images.

Stretch Goals

Integrate real-time data via APIs (e.g., weather or social media feeds).

Deploy your model as a web app (e.g., using Flask or Streamlit).

Compare multiple ML algorithms to optimize performance.
