#### Model 1: Time Series Forecasting Engine
```python
# Primary Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Features Engineering
features = [
    'hour_of_day', 'day_of_week', 'month', 'season',
    'temperature', 'humidity', 'wind_speed', 'pressure',
    'pm25_lag1', 'pm25_lag24', 'pm25_lag168',  # 1hr, 1day, 1week lags
    'no2_lag1', 'o3_lag1', 'population_density'
]

# Target: AQI prediction (24-48 hours ahead)
target = 'aqi_future_24h'
```

#### Model 2: Health Risk Classification
```python
# Primary Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier  
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Health Risk Categories (EPA Standard)
classes = {
    0: 'Good (0-50)',
    1: 'Moderate (51-100)', 
    2: 'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150)',
    3: 'Unhealthy (151-200)',
    4: 'Very Unhealthy (201-300)',
    5: 'Hazardous (301+)'
}
```

#### Model 3: Pattern Discovery (K-Means)
```python
# Unsupervised Learning for insights
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Cluster cities by pollution characteristics
pollution_features = ['avg_pm25', 'avg_no2', 'avg_o3', 'seasonal_variation', 
                     'traffic_correlation', 'industrial_proximity']
```

### Why This Architecture Works Best
